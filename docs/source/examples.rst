Examples
=============

The following examples demonstrate running a StackQL query against a cloud or SaaS provider and returning the results as a ``pandas.DataFrame``.  
For brevity, the examples below assume that the appropriate imports have been specified and that an instance of the :class:`pystackql.StackQL` has been instantiated with the appropriate provider authentication.
For more information, see :ref:`auth-overview` and the `StackQL provider docs <https://registry.stackql.io/>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    from pystackql import StackQL
    import pandas as pd
    stackql = StackQL()

Discover Provider Metadata 
**************************

StackQL provider definitions are extensions of the provider's OpenAPI specification, which exposes all of the provider's services, resources, and operations - making them accessible using SQL grammar.
StackQL allows you to explore the provider's metadata using the ``SHOW`` and ``DESCRIBE`` commands as demonstrated here.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: List all services in a provider
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 2
    
    ...
    query = "SHOW SERVICES in aws"
    df = pd.read_json(stackql.execute(query))
    print(df)
   
.. code-block:: python
    :caption: List all resources in a service
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    ...
    query = "SHOW RESOURCES in azure.compute"
    df = pd.read_json(stackql.execute(query))
    print(df)

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Show the schema of a resource, the optional `EXTENDED` field can be used to show field descriptions
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    ...
    query = "DESCRIBE EXTENDED google.compute.instances"
    df = pd.read_json(stackql.execute(query))
    print(df)


Analyze Cloud Resource Inventory 
********************************

StackQL can be used to collect, analyze, summarize and report on cloud resource inventory data.  The following example shows how to query the AWS EC2 inventory and return the number of instances by instance type.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 4-12

    ...
    regions = ["ap-southeast-2", "us-east-1"]
    query = """
    SELECT '%s' as region, instanceType, COUNT(*) as num_instances
    FROM aws.ec2.instances
    WHERE region = '%s'
    GROUP BY instanceType
    UNION
    SELECT  '%s' as region, instanceType, COUNT(*) as num_instances
    FROM aws.ec2.instances
    WHERE region = '%s'
    GROUP BY instanceType
    """ % (regions[0], regions[0], regions[1], regions[1])
    
    res = stackql.execute(query)
    df = pd.read_json(res)
    print(df)

Using `pystackql` with Pandas and Matplotlib 
********************************************

:mod:`pystackql` can be used with `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ and `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ to create visualizations of the data returned by StackQL queries.
Typically, this would be done in a Jupyter notebook.  The following code can be used to generate a bar chart using :mod:`pystackql`, ``pandas`` and ``matplotlib``:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 12

    ...
    org = "my-okta-org"
    query = """
    SELECT status, COUNT(*) as num
    FROM okta.user.users 
    WHERE subdomain = '%s'
    GROUP BY status
    """ % (org)
    
    res = stackql.execute(query)
    df = pd.read_json(res)
    df.plot(kind='bar', title='User Status', x='status', y='num')

Run CSPM Queries 
****************

StackQL can perform point-in-time or interactive queries against cloud resources to determine if they comply with your organization's security policies. 
This is an example of a CSPM query to find buckets with public access enabled in a Google project.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 4-7

    ...
    project = "stackql-demo"
    query = """
    SELECT name, 
    JSON_EXTRACT(iamConfiguration, '$.publicAccessPrevention') as publicAccessPrevention
    FROM  google.storage.buckets
    WHERE project = '%s'
    """ % (project)
    
    res = stackql.execute(query)
    df = pd.read_json(res)
    print(df)

Run Cross Cloud Provider Queries 
********************************

StackQL can be used to run queries across multiple cloud providers, this can be useful for cross cloud reporting or analysis.
StackQL supports standard SQL set-based operators, including ``UNION`` and ``JOIN``.  Here is an example of a ``UNION`` operation between AWS and GCP.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 6-23

    ...
    project = "stackql-demo"
    gcp_zone = "australia-southeast1-a"
    region = "ap-southeast-2"
    query = """
    select 
     'google' as vendor, 
     name, 
     split_part(split_part(type, '/', 11), '-', 2) as type, 
     status, 
     sizeGb as size 
    from google.compute.disks 
     where project = '%s' 
     and zone = '%s'
    union
    select 
     'aws' as vendor, 
     volumeId as name, 
     volumeType as type, 
     status, 
     size 
     from aws.ec2.volumes 
     where region = '%s'
    """ % (project, gcp_zone, region)
    
    res = stackql.execute(query)
    df = pd.read_json(res)
    print(df)

Deploy Cloud Resources 
**********************

StackQL can be used as an Infrastructure-as-Code solution to deploy cloud resources using the ``INSERT`` command.  Here is an example of deploying a 10GB disk in GCP.
Note that ``INSERT`` operations do not return a dataset, do the :meth:`pystackql.StackQL.executeStmt` is used in this case.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 5-8

    ...
    project = "stackql-demo"
    gcp_zone = "australia-southeast1-a"
    query = """
    INSERT INTO google.compute.disks (project, zone, name, sizeGb) 
    SELECT '%s', 
    '%s', 
    'test10gbdisk', 10;
    """ % (project, gcp_zone)
    
    res = stackql.executeStmt(query)
    print(res)

``DELETE`` and ``UPDATE`` operations are also supported.

.. note:: 

   By default StackQL provider mutation operations are asynchronous (non-blocking), you can make them synchronous by using the ``/*+ AWAIT */`` query hint, for example:

    .. code-block:: sql
    
        INSERT /*+ AWAIT */ INTO google.compute.disks (project, zone, name, sizeGb) 
        SELECT 'stackql-demo', 
        'australia-southeast1-a', 
        'test10gbdisk', 10;

Perform Lifecycle Operations 
****************************

In addition to query, reporting and analysis operations using ``SELECT`` and mutation operations using ``INSERT``, ``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE``, 
StackQL can also be used to perform lifecycle operations on cloud resources using the ``EXEC`` command.
An example of a lifecycle operation is to start a GCP instance.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Start a stopped Compute Engine resource instance (async - default)
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 5-8

    ...
    project = "stackql-demo"
    gcp_zone = "australia-southeast1-a"
    query = """
    EXEC compute.instances.start 
    @instance = 'demo-instance-1', 
    @project = '%s', 
    @zone = '%s';
    """ % (project, gcp_zone)
    
    res = stackql.executeStmt(query)
    print(res)

To make the lifecycle operation synchronous (blocking), use the ``/*+ AWAIT */`` query hint, for example:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Start a stopped Compute Engine resource instance (blocking)
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 5-8

    ...
    project = "stackql-demo"
    gcp_zone = "australia-southeast1-a"
    query = """
    EXEC /*+ AWAIT  */ compute.instances.start 
    @instance = 'demo-instance-1', 
    @project = '%s', 
    @zone = '%s';
    """ % (project, gcp_zone)
    
    res = stackql.executeStmt(query)
    print(res)
